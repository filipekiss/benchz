# Benchz

> Zsh startup time benchmarks

## Installation & usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/filipekiss/benchz
cd benchz
./benchz
```

The script will run two benchmarks: One **vanilla** and your **custom** setup.
You'll get an output like the one below:

```sh
The average startup time for vanilla is: 11 ms
The average startup time for custom is: 125 ms
```

## How it works

The script will startup the shell 100 times and average how long it takes to
completely start it.

## Options

### -n [integer] | default: 100

`./benchz -n 50`

Use this to change how many iterations the script will perform. Defaults to 100
